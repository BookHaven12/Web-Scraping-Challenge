# Web-Scraping-Challenge
In this assignment, I showcased web scraping, data wrangling, and visualization skills to extract, process, and analyze climate data on Mars.

In the first phase, I utilized web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from an HTML source. I efficiently located and parsed relevant elements, iterating through rows and extracting key information. The extracted data was then transformed into a Pandas DataFrame, demonstrating my ability to clean and structure raw data for further analysis.

In the second phase, I applied data manipulation and analysis techniques using Pandas to explore trends in Martian climate. I calculated key metrics such as average minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure by month, leveraging grouping and aggregation (.groupby()). To improve clarity, I used .sort_values() to rank and organize the data effectively.

Finally, I created data visualizations using Matplotlib, including bar charts and time series plots, to illustrate temperature fluctuations and atmospheric patterns over time. I ensured effective presentation through labeled axes and titles to enhance clarity.

# Skills Demonstrated:
* Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
* Data Cleaning & Transformation using Pandas
* Creating and Structuring Pandas DataFrames
* Data Aggregation & Grouping (.groupby(), .mean() )
* Sorting & Indexing (.sort_values() )
* Datetime Formatting & Handling (pd.to_datetime() )
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib ( .plot() )
* Trend Analysis


For this assignment I received help from Brian Perry (TA) on the extracting all the rows in part 2 mars weather.  I also worked with my tutor Angel to create a a more advanced code that extracts botht the header and the data from the Mars table. I used the following class examples from Module 11 Data Collection day 3 for my code: #5 news_solution and #6 mars_facts_scrape_solution.
